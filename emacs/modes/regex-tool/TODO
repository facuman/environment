* TODO [#B] Add regex-tool patch for Emacs 21 support
  (from e-mail [[message://47A86418.6000704@trueposition.com][regex-tool]]): Works okay in emacs 22, but I had to add this
  [attached] to backport to emacs 21.

* TODO [#B] T. Kurt Bond suggested several changes to regex-tool	:ATTACH:
  (from e-mail [[message://uabovlded.fsf@tkb.mpl.com][regex-tool.el patch]]): I've enclosed a patch that adds two
  things:
  
  1. An *Elisp* buffer that shows a quoted version of the regex suitable for
     cutting and pasting into emacs lisp source.  Unfortunately, I didn't take
     into account the perl backend, so it would need some tweaking.
  
  2. Allows more than 9 matches to be displayed, so that 
       \(1\)\(2\)\(3\)\(4\)\(5\)\(6\)\(7\)\(8\)\(9\)\(a\)\(b\)\(c\)\(d\)\(e\)\(f\)
     matched against
       123456789abcdef
     shows all 15 individual matches in addition to the group 0 match.
     (Just look for the change to dotimes.)

* TODO [#B] Patch for / characters in a regular expression		:ATTACH:
  I found a minor bug though: in perl mode it uses m// syntax, but slashes
  aren't escaped in elisp code, which makes the tool fail if I have '/' in
  regexp.  This patch helped me [attached].

* TODO [#B] Apply patch to regex-tool sent by Christian Stucchio	:ATTACH:
  (from e-mail [[message://60424aeb0712270704q263ba990h7b5c7db9eaea058c@mail.gmail.com][regex-tool.el]]): So far, I've only found one thing I dislike:
  the fact that it opens a new frame. I prefer it to open in the current
  frame.
  
  I've attached a slightly modified version in which that behavior is
  customizable. If regex-tool-new-frame is t (the default), the current
  behavior is preserved. If nil, the current frame is used. Steal the code if
  you like it.

* TODO [#A] Apply Johan LindstrXm's regex-tool patch			:ATTACH:
  (from e-mail [[message://200801202043.BYP36639@imap.infopop.com][Regex Tool]]): I just recently started using your excellent Emacs
  Regex Tool.  Very useful, so hats off for that!

  One thing I missed though was the ability of specifying Perl regex
  modifiers, such as /x etc.  So I wrote a patch to change the Perl regex
  syntax from 'MY-REGEX' to '/MY-REGEX/MODIFIERS'

  (It is still aware of /g and multiple matches if needed)

  This patch would change the usage in an incompatible way from before, but
  OTOH this tool is supposedly not used programmatically anyway so that's
  probably not a big deal.
  
  If you think this sounds like a good idea, I'd be very happy for you to
  incorporate it with your package.
