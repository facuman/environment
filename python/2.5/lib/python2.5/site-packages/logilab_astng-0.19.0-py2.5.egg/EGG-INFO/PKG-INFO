Description: The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
        python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,
        pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentialy
        governed by pylint's needs.
        
        It extends class defined in the compiler.ast [1] module (python <= 2.4) or in
        the builtin _ast module (python >= 2.5) with some additional methods and
        attributes. Instance attributes are added by a builder object, which can either
        generate extended ast (let's call them astng ;) by visiting an existant ast
        tree or by inspecting living object. Methods are added by monkey patching ast
        classes.
