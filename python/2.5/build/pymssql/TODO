Serious/important:

Moderate:
- Sybase compatibility update (private mail from Kurt Sutter on 2009-04-24)
  didn't make it into 1.0.2
- improve inline documentation strings - that's job for English native speakers
- fix apitest_mssql.py
- test on big-endian platforms

Low priority:
- try to call dbexit() on module dealloc / python unload (how?)

Other notes:
- when and how to use unicode(row[index], 'fancy-encoding', 'ignore')
